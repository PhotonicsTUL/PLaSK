# PLaSK

Photonic Laser Simulation Kit is a comprehensive tool for numerical analysis
of broad range of physical phenomena in photonic devices. It has been designed
for simulating mainly semiconductor lasers, however the range of the covered
devices is much larger and includes e.g. transistors, light emitting diodes,
photodetectors, etc. Due to its modular nature it is possible to perform
computations of virtually any physical phenomenon in micro-scale structures.

PLaSK has been originally developed in a Photonics Group of Lodz University of Technology, which
has many-year experience in numerical analysis of semiconductor lasers. Such structures, due to their
complex structure, often fail to be correctly simulated by popular general-purpose software.
However, in designing PLaSK we have taken special care to consider all the special cases
of semiconductor lasers and to choose (or invent where necessary) appropriate algorithms.
