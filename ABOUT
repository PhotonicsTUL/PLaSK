 Photonic Laser Simulation Kit is a comprehensive tool for numerical analysis
 of broad range of physical phenomena in photonic devices. It has been designed
 for simulating mainly semiconductor lasers, however the range of the covered
 devices is much larger and includes e.g. transistors, light emitting diodes,
 photodetectors, etc. Due to its modular nature it is possible to perform
 computations of virtually any physical phenomenon in micro-scale structures.
