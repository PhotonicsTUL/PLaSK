    Data(array, mesh)

        Data returned by field providers.

        This class is returned by field providers and receivers and cointains the values
        of the computed field at specified mesh points. It can be passed to the field
        plotting and saving functions or even feeded to some receivers. Also, if the
        mesh is a rectangular one, the data can be converted into an multi-dimensional
        numpy array.

        You may access the data by indexing the :class:`~plask.Data` object, where the
        index always corresponds to the index of the mesh point where the particular
        value is specified. Hence, you may also iterate :class:`~plask.Data` objects as
        normal Python sequences.

        You may construct the data object manually from a numpy array and a mesh.
        The constructor always take two argumentsa as specified below:

        Args:
            array: The array with a custom data.
                It must be either a one dimensional array with sequential data of the
                desired type corresponding to the sequential mesh points or (for the
                rectangular meshes) an array with the same shape as returned by the
                :attr:`array` attribute.
            mesh: The mesh specifying where the data points are located.
                The size of the mesh must be equal to the size of the provided array.
                Furthermore, when constructing the data from the structured array, the
                mesh ordering must match the data stride, so it is possible to avoid
                data copying (defaults for both are fine).
        Returns:
            plask._Data: Data based on the specified mesh and array.

        Examples:
            To create the data from the flat sequential array:

            >>> msh = plask.mesh.Rectangular2D(plask.mesh.Rectilinear([1, 2, 3]),
            ... plask.mesh.Rectilinear([10, 20]))
            >>> Data(array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6.]), msh)
            <plask.Data at 0x4698938>

            As the ``msh`` is a rectangular mesh, the data can be created from the
            structured array with the shape (3, 2), as the first and second mesh
            dimensions are 3 and 2, respectively:

            >>> dat = Data(array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.], [5., 6.]]), msh)
            >>> dat[0]
            1.0

            By adding one more dimension, you can create an array of vectors:

            >>> d = Data(array([[[1.,0.], [2.,0.]], [[3.,0.], [4.,1.]],
            ...                 [[5.,1.], [6.,1.]]]), msh)
            >>> d.dtype
            plask.vec
            >>> d[1]
            plask.vec(2, 0)
            >>> d.array[:,:,0]    # retrieve first components of all the vectors
            array([[1., 2.], [3., 4.], [5., 6.]])

        Construction of the data objects is efficient i.e. no data is copied in the
        memory from the provided array.

    override :meth:`on_initialize` of :meth:`on_invalidate` methods, they will be
    called once on the solver initialization/invalidation.

    Examples:
        Create two-dimensional vector:

        >>> vector(1, 2)
        vector(1, 2)

        Create 3D vector specifying components in rotated coordinate system:

        >>> config.axes = 'xy'
        >>> vec(x=1, y=2, z=3)
        plask.vec(3, 1, 2)

        Create 3D vector specifying components:

        >>> config.axes = 'xyz'
        >>> vec(x=1, z=2, y=3)
        plask.vec(1, 3, 2)

        Create 2D vector in cylindrical coordinates, specifying dtype:

        >>> config.axes = 'rz'
        >>> vec(r=2, z=0, dtype=complex)
        plask.vec((2+0j), (0+0j))

    To access vector components you may either use attribute names or numerical
    indexing. The ordering and naming rules are the same as for the construction.

    Examples:

        >>> config.axes = 'xyz'
        >>> v = vec(1, 2, 3)
        >>> v.z
        3
        >>> v[0]
        1

    You may perform all the proper algebraic operations on PLaSK vectors like
    addition, subtraction, multiplication by scalar, multiplication by another
    vector (which results in a dot product).

    Example:

        >>> v1 = vec(1, 2, 3)
        >>> v2 = vec(10, 20, 30)
        >>> v1 + v2
        plask.vec(11, 22, 33)
        >>> 2 * v1
        plask.vec(2, 4, 6)
        >>> v1 * v2
        140.0
        >>> abs(v1)
        >>> v3 = vec(0, 1+2j)
        >>> v3.conj()
        plask.vec(0, 1-2j)
        >>> v3.abs2()
        5.0
