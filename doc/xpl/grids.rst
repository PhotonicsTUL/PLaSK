Section <grids>
===============

.. xml:tag:: <grids>

In this section one can define computational meshes for use by solvers. It can be done by one of the two ways: either by specifying the mesh directly or, by creating a generator that will automatically construct the required mesh basing on the structure geometry when the calculations in the solver using particular generator are about to begin. Hence the two allowed tags in this section are ``<mesh>`` and ``<generator>``. The contents of these tags are determined by the particular mesh or generator type, while their attributes are always the same:

.. xml:tag:: <generator>

   Specification of the mesh generator.

   :attr required name: Object name for further reference.
   :attr required type: Type of the mesh to generate.
   :attr required method: Generation method i.e. the type of the generator.

   .. xml:contents::

       The content of this element depends on the values of the type and method tag. It specifies generator configuration (if any). See below for details.

.. xml:tag:: <mesh>

   Specification of the mesh.

   :attr required name: Name of the mesh for reference in configuration of the solvers.
   :attr required type: Type of the mesh.

   .. xml:contents::

       The content of this element depends on the value of the type tag. See below for details.

.. xml:tag:: <generator type="triangular2d" method="triangle"> [triangular2d, triangle]

   Generator which creates triangular mesh by *Triangle* library authored by **Jonathan Richard Shewchuk**.

   Citing official *Triangle* documentation: *Triangle* generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay triangulations, conforming Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and high-quality triangular meshes. The latter can be generated with no small or large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis.

   See: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html

   .. xml:contents::

      .. xml:tag:: <options/> [in triangular2d, triangle generator]

         :attr maxarea: A maximum triangle area constraint. (float [µm²])

         Citing official *Triangle* documentation (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.q.html): If the minimum angle is 20.7° or smaller, the triangulation algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to terminate (assuming infinite precision arithmetic - *Triangle* may fail to terminate if you run out of precision). In practice, the algorithm often succeeds for minimum angles up to 33°. It usually does not terminate for angles above 34°. For some meshes, however, it may be necessary to reduce the minimum angle to well below 20° to avoid problems associated with insufficient floating-point precision.

               :attr required object: Name of the geometry object to add additional division to.
               :attr path: Path name, specifying particular instance of the object given in the object attribute.
               :attr at: If this attribute is present, a single refinement line is placed at the position specified in it (in the local object coordinates).
               :attr by: If this attribute is present, multiple refinement lines are placed dividing the object into a specified number of equal parts.
               :attr every: If this attribute is present, multiple refinement lines are places at distance from each other specified in the attribute value.

               Exactly one of ``at``, ``by``, or ``every`` attribute must be present.

            .. xml:tag:: <axis1/> [in rectangular3d, divide generator]

               Add refinement to the transverse axis.

               It has same attributes as :xml:tag:`<axis0/> [in rectangular3d, divide generator]`.

            .. xml:tag:: <axis2/> [in rectangular3d, divide generator]

               Add refinement to the vertical axis.

               It has same attributes as :xml:tag:`<axis0/> [in rectangular3d, divide generator]`.

      .. xml:tag:: <warnings/>

         Control printing of the warnings.

         :attr missing: Warn if any refinement references to non-existing object. Defaults to ‘yes’. (bool)
         :attr multiple: Warn if any refinement references to multiple objects. Defaults to ‘yes’. (bool)
         :attr outside: Warn if refining line lies outside of the specified object. Defaults to ‘yes’. (bool)
