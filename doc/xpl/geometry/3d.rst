Geometry objects 3D
-------------------

The following elements are specifying two-dimensional geometry objects for use with 3D geometries. Each of them can have an optional attribute name, which allows to give the name to the object for further reference (either in the geometry specification or in the computational script). The correct value of the object name is unique identifier string.
