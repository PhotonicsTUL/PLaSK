# This is a YAML file for your solver specification. You must modify it accordingly to your
# solver's configuration. For general information on YAML files, take a look at

# If your library has more than one solver, make separate 'solver' element for each one of them:
- solver: SimpleOpticalCyl2D
  lib: simple_optical_template
  category: optical
  help: >
