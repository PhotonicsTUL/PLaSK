# This is a YAML file for your solver specification. You must modify it accordingly to your
# solver's configuration. For general information on YAML files, take a look at
# https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/yaml

# If your library has more than one solver, make separate 'solver' element for each one of them:
- solver: FDTD2D
  lib: fdtd
  category: optical
  # This is a description of your solver that will appear in the user manual.
  help: >
    Test skeleton for the FDTD solver.

  # Specify geometry type of your solver here:
  geometry: Cartesian2D

  #  Specify each configuration tag:
  tags:
  - tag: comp_space                     # tag name
    label: Computational grid                    # label shown in GUI
