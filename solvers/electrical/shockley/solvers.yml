- solver: ActiveCond2D
  lib: shockley
  category: electrical
  help: >
    Two-dimensional phenomenological solver in Cartesian geometry based on custom active region conductivity
    and using finite-element method. To use this solver, you must create a Python function taking the junction voltage,
    current density and temperature as arguments and returning junction conductivity. The returned value must be either
    a dwo-dimensional tensor or a single value, in which case the conductivity is assumed to be zero in lateral direction.
    Next, you must assign this function to the `cond` (or `cond0`, `cond1` etc. for multiple active regions) of the solver.

    Example:
        >>> solver.cond = lambda U, jy, T: 5.0
