  <solver name="FermiNew2D" category="gain" lib="complex">
    Simple gain solver based on Fermi Golden Rule for two-dimensional Cartesian geometry.

    This solver does not use any mesh by default and the the full gain calculation is performed in each requested point.
    However, if there is a mesh specified then the gain is computed only in the mesh points and interpolated in-between.

      Some important gain parameters.
      <attr name="lifetime" label="Carriers lifetime" type="float" unit="ps">
        Average carriers lifetime. This parameter is used for gain spectrum broadening.

        Value of the squared matrix element in gain computations.
        If it is not set it is estimated automatically.
      </attr>
      <attr name="matrix-elem-scaling" label="Matrix element scaling" type="float">
        Scaling factor for optical matrix element. If left blank, no scalling to matrix element is applied.

      <attr name="strained" label="Strained" type="bool">
        Boolean attribute indicated if the solver should consider strain in the active region.
        If set to &lt;i&gt;yes&lt;/i&gt; then there must a layer with the role "&lt;i&gt;substrate&lt;/i&gt;"
        in the geometry. The strain is computed by comparing the atomic lattice constants of the substrate and
        the quantum wells.

          Roughness of the thicknesses of the quantum wells.

            Compute levels only once and simply shift for different temperatures?
