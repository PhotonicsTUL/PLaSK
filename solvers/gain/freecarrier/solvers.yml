    Quantum-well gain using free-carrier approximation for two-dimensional Cartesian geometry.

    This solver does not use any mesh by default and the the full gain calculation is performed in each requested point.
    However, if there is a mesh specified then the gain is computed only in the mesh points and interpolated in-between.

      type: bool
      default: false
      help: Boolean attribute indicating if the solver should consider strain in the active region. If set
        to <i>yes</i> then there must a layer with the role "<i>substrate</i>" in the geometry. The strain
        is computed by comparing the atomic lattice constants of the substrate and the quantum wells.
