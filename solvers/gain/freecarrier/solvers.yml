    - attr: lifetime
      label: Carriers lifetime
      type: float
      unit: ps
      default: 0.1
      help: Average carriers lifetime. This parameter is used for gain spectrum broadening.
    - attr: matrix-elem
      label: Momentum matrix element
      type: float
      unit: eVÃ—m<sub>0</sub>
      help: Value of the squared matrix element in gain computations. If it is not set it is estimated automatically.
    - attr: strained
      label: Strained
      type: bool
      default: false
      help: Boolean attribute indicating if the solver should consider strain in the active region. If set
        to <i>yes</i> then there must a layer with the role "<i>substrate</i>" in the geometry. The strain
        is computed by comparing the atomic lattice constants of the substrate and the quantum wells.
    - attr: T0
      label: Reference temperature
      type: float
      unit: K
      default: 300
      help: Reference temperature. This is the temperature used for initial computation of the energy levels.
