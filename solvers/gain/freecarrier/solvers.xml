  <solver name="FreeCarrier2D" category="gain" lib="freecarrier">
    Quantum-well gain using free-carrier approximation for two-dimensional Cartesian geometry.

    This solver does not use any mesh by default and the the full gain calculation is performed in each requested point.
    However, if there is a mesh specified then the gain is computed only in the mesh points and interpolated in-between.
